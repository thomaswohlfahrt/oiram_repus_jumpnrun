Oiram Repus - Jump and Run Game Project in C++
====================

jump n run game 2D, incl map builder, study project, SDL1.2



To compile the Game, have a look at the .pro file from QT.

The Librarypath to the static libraries is needed (LIBS += -L...)

Just put .dlls in exec dir - not very nice, but was the easiest way.
